# Deadlipper

**Work in Progress**

Deadlipper is a chaotic game where you drop a ball down a falling map full of traps, trying to deal as much damage as possible.

## How it works

* Place traps on a map that constantly moves downward.
* Drop the ball and maximize the damage it takes.
* Activate traps in real-time while the ball is falling.
